octsympy 2.3.0-dev
==================

  * New commands:

          cbrt
          linspace
          logspace
          max
          min

  * Bug fix for working with certain unevaluated integrals.

  * Bug fixes for function_handle, fortran and ccode.

  * Calling "inv" on a singular matrix now explicitly gives an error.

  * Fourier and Laplace transforms (and their inverses) use a
    different implementation which improves handling of delta
    functions.  Ideally, a later version will consolidate this with
    SymPy's original implementations.

  * Documentation improvements.



octsympy 2.2.4 (2015-12-14)
===========================

  * Fix display on Octave 3.8.

  * Support for SymPy 0.7.6.1.



octsympy 2.2.3 (2015-11-25)
===========================

  * New commands:

          cross
          dot

  * sym('var') is more robust in case var happens to be a special
    value in SymPy.  Now sym('E') is just a symbol rather than
    exp(sym(1)).  Also sym('E1') and sym('Eq') no longer give errors.

  * Fix bug in assigning to column vectors, thanks to Grzegorz Dudziuk.

  * During install, test for PATH problems on Windows (issue #236).

  * Fix for Octave 4.1+ development versions, thanks to Mike Miller.



octsympy 2.2.2 (2015-07-03)
===========================

  * Fix for configure script using Python 3 (thanks Vadim Gribanov).

  * Fourier transform fixes (thanks Alexander Misel, Andrés Prieto).
    They now follow the non-unitary angular frequency convention.

  * Support for SymPy 0.7.7.dev version.

  * Add some warnings to the documentation about unreliable results
    for "dsolve" on systems and from Fourier transforms.

  * Start using "print_usage" for invalid inputs as is common
    practice in Octave.

  * Bug fixes and update doctests.



octsympy 2.2.1 (2015-04-22)
===========================

  * Fix an ascii pretty printing regression (issue #234).

  * Other minor fixes for doctests, sympref and symreplace.



octsympy 2.2.0 (2015-04-20)
===========================

  * New commands:

          catalan
          eulergamma
          lambertw

  * Installing symbolic package now check for Python and minimum
    version of SymPy (thanks Carnë Draug for autoconf).

  * Installations from Octave-Forge ("pkg install -forge symbolic")
    should now work on Windows (thanks vassbu).  You will need the
    Python and SymPy dependencies.  Or you can use the [bundled
    package](https://github.com/cbm755/octsympy/releases)

  * Added support for Python 3 (still works with Python 2 as well).

  * Documentation improvements especially to assumptions.  Examples
    within documentation can now be tested with doctests, see the
    `octsympy_doctests.m` function.

  * Fix a warning on Octave 4.0.0-rc1 and make tests work properly.

  * Other bug fixes: assumptions; symvar and symbolic matrix powers;
    various display issues.



octsympy 2.1.0 (2015-03-06)
===========================

  * New commands:

          columns
          degree
          formula
          ismatrix
          numden
          rows

  * Additional ways of calling symsum, symprod, and subs for better
    compatibility with other symbolic toolboxes.

  * Bug fixes in poly2sym, sym2poly, symfun (thanks @rocketsound),
    prod, horner, coeffs.

  * Documentation improvements.

  * Improvements to "argnames" and "formula" for the dependent
    variables and dependent expression of a symfun.  These are now
    implemented for basic sym objects as well.

  * Improvements to assumptions.  E.g., `x = assume(x, 'positive')` no
    longer mucks around in the workspace for other instances of x (it
    still does this with no output argument, for compatibility with
    other symbolic toolboxes).  You can use multiple assumptions with
    sym and syms, e.g., `syms n m positive even`.

  * Improve symbolic sized matrices such as `A = sym('a', [n m])`.
    These are still experimental; they correspond to MatixSymbols in
    SymPy and may need a recent SymPy development version.  For now,
    the `size(A)` returns "1x1" although internally `NaN` is used for
    symbolic-sized dimensions.  Enabling `size(A)` to return "NaNx3"
    may occur later.

  * Drop python_cmd_string, which has been deprecated since v0.1.1.



octsympy 2.0.0 (2015-02-04)
===========================

 *  Octsympy is now the "symbolic" package for Octave Forge.  There
    was a previous "symbolic" package (based on GiNaC) which reached
    version 1.1.0.  To prevent confusion, we are now at version 2.0.0.
    Additionally, the history of the two projects has been merged
    (thanks Carnë Draug).

 *  New commands:

          coeffs
          ipermute
          isallconstant
          isconstant
          nchoosek
          permute

 *  Fixes for development version of SymPy.

 *  Fixes for vpa and vpasolve: high precision should be more reliable.

 *  Improve handling `sym(pi/3)` and other small fractions of pi.  It
    works but you'll still get a warning and 2*sym(pi)/3 is really the
    preferred approach!  `sym(-pi)` now works.

 *  On Windows, default to ascii rendering for now (until unicode
    is fixed in Octave on that platform).

 *  No longer needs to autogenerate a bunch of functions at install
    time: hopefully making it easier than ever to get involved!



octsympy 0.1.3 (2015-01-06)
===========================

 *  New commands:

          argnames           partfrac
          digits             orth
          ilaplace           rank
          laplace            rref
          ldivide            sum
          mldivide           vpa
          null               vpasolve

 *  Symbolic backslash support.

 *  variable-precision arithmetic support: see vpa, digits, vpasolve.

 *  Much-improved dsolve thanks to Andrés Prieto.

 *  Laplace and inverse Laplace transforms (Andrés Prieto).

 *  Partial fractions (Andrés Prieto).

 *  Improvements to solve (Andrés Prieto).

 *  Preliminary support for matrix expressions, e.g., matrix to a symbolic
    power.

 *  Should work properly with Stand-alone Python (thanks to David Manthey).



octsympy 0.1.2 (2014-12-01)
===========================

 *  New commands:

          children           rhs
          expm               setdiff
          lhs                setxor
          pinv               trace
          potential

 *  Support new SymPy 0.7.6.  This adds Octave code generation which means
    that OctSymPy's `matlabFunction` is supported.

 *  For now, SymPy 0.7.5 should still work, but upgrading to SymPy 0.7.6 is
    recommended.



octsympy 0.1.1 (2014-10-20)  Rose Garden
========================================

Major Changes
-------------

 *  Fix sym(double) approx by rationals (issue #121, thanks HuiZhong LU).

 *  Improvements to sym() command: you can now pass the underlying "srepr"
    SymPy presentation to create an object.

 *  Bug fixes: improvements to indexing, findsymbols and assumptions,
    isscalar/isvector failures on recent Octave, output formatting fixes,

 *  New commands:

          and             isscalar
          char            isvector
          diag            nnz
          eig             or
          iscolumn        uplus
          isrow           xor


Minor Changes
-------------

 *  Improvements to logical and isAlways commands.

 *  IPC system() should work on windows.

 *  Better test system, easier to see "real" failures rather than expected
    (known) failures.

 *  Improved handling of symfuns.

 *  Improvements to internal string handling/escaping especially newlines.

     -  Enter a multiline command using a cell array of lines e.g.,
        `python_cmd({'a = 10' 'return (a, 2*a)'})
        or
        `python_cmd({'a = 10'; 'return (a, 2*a)'})
     -  The same applies to `evalpy`.  If you need the old deprecated
        behaviour, it is still available as `python_cmd_string`.



octsympy 0.1.0 (2014-08-27)  Pacific Coffee
===========================================

Major Changes
-------------

 *  `sympref` replaces `octsympy_config`.  You can change the Python
    interpreter with `sympref python /path/to/python`.

 *  Unicode pretty-printed output by default.

     -  If you see `?` or other broken characters, try `sympref display
        ascii`.  Then help me get this working on your system!

     -  Or `sympref display flat` to disable pretty-printing.  (You can
        still use the `pretty` command selectively).

 *  Experimental Windows package with Python and SymPy included (look
    Ma, no deps!)  Uses [David Manthey's single file py.exe Python] [1].

    [1]: http://www.orbitals.com/programs/pyexe.html

 *  Lots of new commands:

          atan2           fliplr         isfinite          norm
          ccode           flipud         isna              not
          cond            fortran        jacobian          qr
          conj            ge             laplacian         real
          curl            gradient       le                repmat
          det             gt             lt                svd
          divergence      hessian        lu                toeplitz
          ezplot3         imag           matlabFunction    tril
          ezplot          inv            ne                triu

 *  Preliminary code generation (`ccode`, `fortran` and
    `matlabFunction` functions).  However, `matlabFunction` mostly
    depends on patches not yet in upstream SymPy.

 *  Inequality support.

 *  Assumptions now behave more like the Matlab Symbolic Math Toolbox.


Minor or internal changes
-------------------------

 *  Arithmetic operations on symfuns return symfuns instead of syms.

 *  More robust XML-like IPC transport.

 *  Move to proper Octave-style `%!` tests.

 *  Debugging IPC modes: `systmpfile` (same as `system` but outputs a
    temp file for inspection) and `sysoneline` (work-in-progress).



octsympy 0.0.4 (2014-05-26)  Lovever Coffee
===========================================

 *  Basic assumptions support.

 *  Matlab packages, only slow system() ipc for now.

 *  Improvements on passing variables between Octave and Python.



octsympy 0.0.3 (2014-04-29)  Wu Ke Song
=======================================

 *  Many new commands.

 *  `system()` communication no longer makes temporary files.  To
    change the communication mechanism, use "octsympy_config ipc
    system". See also "help octsympy_config".

 *  Added new tool "evalpy", this is fun and good for debugging...

 *  Bugs fixed, docs updated

 *  Start documenting differences with the Matlab Symbolic Math
    Toolbox.



octsympy 0.0.2 (2014-04-20)
===========================

 *  A preview release, test it out report issues.  Documentation is a
    mess, various things are work-in-progress.  But it works and I
    think has potential.
